  abstract = {Supersonic relative motion between baryons and dark matter due to the decoupling of baryons from the primordial plasma after recombination affects the growth of the first small-scale structures. Large box sizes (greater than a few hundred Mpc) are required to sample the full range of scales pertinent to the relative velocity, while the effect of the relative velocity is strongest on small scales (less than a few hundred kpc). This separation of scales naturally lends itself to the use of 'zoom' simulations, and here we present our methodology to self-consistently incorporate the relative velocity in zoom simulations, including its cumulative effect from recombination through to the start time of the simulation. We apply our methodology to a large-scale cosmological zoom simulation, finding that the inclusion of relative velocities suppresses the halo baryon fraction by 46-23 per cent between z = 13.6 and 11.2, in qualitative agreement with previous works. In addition, we find that including the relative velocity delays the formation of star particles by {\textasciitilde}20 Myr on average (of the order of the lifetime of a {\textasciitilde}9 M{$\odot$} Population III star) and suppresses the final stellar mass by as much as 79 per cent at z = 11.2.},

  abstract = {Recent work has suggested that, during reionisation, spatial variations in the ionising radiation field should produce enhanced Ly \$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ forest transmission at distances of tens of comoving Mpc from high-redshift galaxies. We demonstrate that the Sherwood-Relics suite of hybrid radiation-hydrodynamical simulations are qualitatively consistent with this interpretation. The shape of the galaxy--Ly \$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ transmission cross-correlation is sensitive to both the mass of the haloes hosting the galaxies and the volume averaged fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM, \${\textbackslash}bar\{x\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm HI\}\$. The reported excess Ly \$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ forest transmission on scales r {\textasciitilde} 10 cMpc at \${\textbackslash}langle z {\textbackslash}rangle {\textbackslash}approx 5.2\$ -- as measured using C IV absorbers as proxies for high-redshift galaxies -- is quantitatively reproduced by Sherwood-Relics at z = 6 if we assume the galaxies that produce ionising photons are hosted in haloes with mass \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}{\textbackslash}geq 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. However, this redshift mismatch is equivalent to requiring \${\textbackslash}bar\{x\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm HI\}{\textbackslash}sim 0.1\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}simeq 5.2\$, which is inconsistent with the observed Ly \$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ forest effective optical depth distribution. We speculate this tension may be partly resolved if the minimum C IV absorber host halo mass at z {$>$} 5 is larger than \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. After reionisation completes, relic IGM temperature fluctuations will continue to influence the shape of the cross-correlation on scales of a few comoving Mpc at \$4 {\textbackslash}leq z {\textbackslash}leq 5\$. Constraining the redshift evolution of the cross-correlation over this period may therefore provide further insight into the timing of reionisation.},

Here, we investigate \${\textbackslash}lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$ predicted by the Sherwood-Relics suite of hybrid radiation hydrodynamical simulations. Simulations with comoving volumes of \$40{\textasciicircum}\{3\}{\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, cMpc{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$ (\$160{\textasciicircum}\{3\}{\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, cMpc{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$), calibrated to match the observed Ly \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest transmission with a late end to reionization at \$z 6\$, are consistent with recent \${\textbackslash}lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$ measurements at \$z 5.9\$, and are \$1.2{\textbackslash}sigma\$ (\$1.8{\textbackslash}sigma\$) above the highest redshift \${\textbackslash}lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$ measurement at \$z=5.93\$. The majority of the Lyman-limit opacity at the end of reionization is attributable to highly ionized Ly \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest absorbers with neutral hydrogen column densities \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm HI\} {\textbackslash}leq 10{\textasciicircum}\{16\}\$-\$10{\textasciicircum}\{17\}{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$. Resolving these systems is critical for capturing the redshift evolution of \${\textbackslash}lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$ during the final stages of reionization. After reionization completes, overdense gas will reduce \${\textbackslash}lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$ by up to 20 per cent around haloes with masses \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}\$-\$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, but during reionization ionized bubbles will instead boost \${\textbackslash}lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$ around haloes by up to an order of magnitude when the IGM is as much as 90 per cent neutral by volume. This effect will play an important role in the visibility of Ly \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emitting galaxies at \$zrsim 10\$ discovered with JWST.},

In this work we analyse a suite of fully-coupled radiation-hydrodynamics simulations based on RAMSES-CUDATON to calculate and study the tSZ signal from the Reionization Epoch.

  abstract = {Recent determinations of the mean free path of ionizing photons (mfp) in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z = 6 are lower than many theoretical predictions. In order to gain insight, we investigate the evolution of the mfp in our new massive fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics cosmological simulation of reionization: Cosmic Dawn III (CoDa III). CoDa III's scale (\${\textbackslash}rm 94{\textasciicircum}3 {\textbackslash}, cMpc{\textasciicircum}3\$) and resolution (\${\textbackslash}rm 8192{\textasciicircum}3\$ grid) make it particularly suitable to study the IGM during reionization. The simulation was performed with RAMSES-CUDATON on Summit, and used 13 1072 processors coupled to 24 576 GPUs, making it the largest reionization simulation, and largest ever RAMSES simulation. A superior agreement with global constraints on reionization is obtained in CoDa III over Cosmic Dawn II (CoDa II), especially for the evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction and the cosmic photoionization rate, thanks to an improved calibration, later end of reionization (z = 5.6), and higher spatial resolution. Analysing the mfp, we find that CoDa III reproduces the most recent observations very well, from z = 6 to z = 4.6. We show that the distribution of the mfp in CoDa III is bimodal, with short (neutral) and long (ionized) mfp modes, due to the patchiness of reionization and the coexistence of neutral versus ionized regions during reionization. The neutral mode peaks at sub-kpc to kpc scales of mfp, while the ionized mode peak evolves from 0.1 Mpc h-1 at z = 7 to {\textasciitilde}10 Mpc h-1 at z = 5.2. Computing the mfp as the average of the ionized mode provides the best match to the recent observational determinations. The distribution reduces to a single neutral (ionized) mode at z {$>$} 13 (z {$<$} 5).},

  abstract = {We investigate the spatial offsets between dust and ultraviolet (UV) emission in high-redshift galaxies using the Cosmic Dawn III (CoDa III) simulation, a state-of-the-art fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics cosmological simulation. Recent observations have revealed puzzling spatial disparities between ALMA dust continuum and UV emission as seen by HST and JWST in galaxies at z=5-7, compelling us to propose a physical interpretation of such offsets. Our simulation, which incorporates a dynamical dust model, naturally reproduces these offsets in massive, UV-bright galaxies (log\$\_\{10\}\$(M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{DM\}\}\$/M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$){$>$}11.5, M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{AB1500\}\}\${$<$}-20). We find that dust-UV offsets increase with halo mass and UV brightness, reaching up to \${\textbackslash}sim 2\$ pkpc for the most massive systems, in good agreement with observational data from the ALPINE and REBELS surveys. Our analysis reveals that these offsets primarily result from severe dust extinction in galactic centers rather than a misalignment between dust and stellar mass distributions. The dust remains well-aligned with the bulk stellar component, and we predict the dust continuum should therefore align well with the stellar rest-frame NIR component, less affected by dust attenuation. This study provides crucial insights into the complex interplay between star formation, dust distribution, and observed galaxy morphologies during the epoch of reionization, highlighting the importance of dust in shaping the appearance of early galaxies at UV wavelengths.},

  abstract = {The shape of the Ly-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ transmission in the near zone of the redshift \$z=5.9896\$ quasar ULAS J0148\$+\$0600 (hereafter J0148) is consistent with a damping wing arising from an extended neutral hydrogen island in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM). Here we use simulations of late-ending reionisation from Sherwood-Relics to assess the expected incidence of quasars with Ly-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and Ly-\${\textbackslash}beta\$ absorption similar to the observed J0148 spectrum. We find a late end to reionisation at \$z=5.3\$ is a necessary requirement for reproducing a Ly-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ damping wing consistent with J0148. This occurs in \${\textbackslash}sim3\$ per cent of our simulated spectra for an IGM neutral fraction \${\textbackslash}langle x\_\{{\textbackslash}rm HI\}{\textbackslash}rangle=0.14\$ at \$z=6\$. However, using standard assumptions for the ionising photon output of J0148, the a priori probability of drawing a simulated quasar spectrum with a Ly-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ damping wing profile and Ly-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ near zone size that simultaneously match J0148 is very low, \$p{$<$}10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$. We speculate this is because the ionising emission from J0148 is variable on timescales \$t{$<$}10{\textasciicircum}\{5\}{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},yr\$, or alternatively that the Ly-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ transmission in the J0148 near zone is impacted by the transverse proximity effect from nearby star-forming galaxies or undetected quasars. We also predict the IGM temperature should be \$T{\textbackslash}sim 4{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{4\}{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},K\$ within a few proper Mpc of the Ly-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ near zone edge due to recent HI and HeII photo-heating. Evidence for enhanced thermal broadening in the Ly-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ absorption near the damping wing edge would provide further evidence that the final stages of reionisation are occurring at \$z{$<$}6\$.},

By reproducing and testing networks previously used in the field, and applied to 21cmFast and Simfast21 simulations, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often learn to identify features of individual simulation boxes rather than the underlying physics, limiting their applicability to real observations. We examine the prediction of the neutral fraction and astrophysical parameters from 21 cm maps and find that networks typically fail to generalise to unseen simulations. We explore a number of case studies to highlight factors that improve or degrade network performance. These results emphasise the responsibility on users to ensure ML models are applied correctly in 21 cm cosmology.},
