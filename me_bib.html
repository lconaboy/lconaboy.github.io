  abstract = {Supersonic relative motion between baryons and dark matter due to the decoupling of baryons from the primordial plasma after recombination affects the growth of the first small-scale structures. Large box sizes (greater than a few hundred Mpc) are required to sample the full range of scales pertinent to the relative velocity, while the effect of the relative velocity is strongest on small scales (less than a few hundred kpc). This separation of scales naturally lends itself to the use of 'zoom' simulations, and here we present our methodology to self-consistently incorporate the relative velocity in zoom simulations, including its cumulative effect from recombination through to the start time of the simulation. We apply our methodology to a large-scale cosmological zoom simulation, finding that the inclusion of relative velocities suppresses the halo baryon fraction by 46-23 per cent between z = 13.6 and 11.2, in qualitative agreement with previous works. In addition, we find that including the relative velocity delays the formation of star particles by {\textasciitilde}20 Myr on average (of the order of the lifetime of a {\textasciitilde}9 M{$\odot$} Population III star) and suppresses the final stellar mass by as much as 79 per cent at z = 11.2.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence supporting reionization ending at redshift \$z {\textbackslash}lesssim 6\$ includes the rapid redshift evolution of the mean free path, \${\textbackslash}lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$, for Lyman-limit photons through the intergalactic medium (IGM) at \$5 z 6\$. Here, we investigate \${\textbackslash}lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$ predicted by the Sherwood-Relics suite of hybrid radiation hydrodynamical simulations. Simulations with comoving volumes of \$40{\textasciicircum}\{3\}{\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, cMpc{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$ (\$160{\textasciicircum}\{3\}{\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, cMpc{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$), calibrated to match the observed Ly \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest transmission with a late end to reionization at \$z 6\$, are consistent with recent \${\textbackslash}lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$ measurements at \$z 5.9\$, and are \$1.2{\textbackslash}sigma\$ (\$1.8{\textbackslash}sigma\$) above the highest redshift \${\textbackslash}lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$ measurement at \$z=5.93\$. The majority of the Lyman-limit opacity at the end of reionization is attributable to highly ionized Ly \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest absorbers with neutral hydrogen column densities \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm HI\} {\textbackslash}leq 10{\textasciicircum}\{16\}\$-\$10{\textasciicircum}\{17\}{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$. Resolving these systems is critical for capturing the redshift evolution of \${\textbackslash}lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$ during the final stages of reionization. After reionization completes, overdense gas will reduce \${\textbackslash}lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$ by up to 20 per cent around haloes with masses \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}\$-\$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, but during reionization ionized bubbles will instead boost \${\textbackslash}lambda \_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$ around haloes by up to an order of magnitude when the IGM is as much as 90 per cent neutral by volume. This effect will play an important role in the visibility of Ly \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emitting galaxies at \$zrsim 10\$ discovered with JWST.},

  abstract = {The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect arises from inverse Compton scattering of low energy photons onto thermal electrons, proportional to the integrated electron pressure, and is usually observed from galaxy clusters. However, we can expect that the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) also contributes to this signal, but that contribution has not been previously evaluated. In this work we analyse a suite of fully-coupled radiation-hydrodynamics simulations based on RAMSES-CUDATON to calculate and study the tSZ signal from the Reionization Epoch. We construct lightcones of the electron pressure in the intergalactic medium for \$6},

  abstract = {Recent determinations of the mean free path of ionizing photons (mfp) in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z = 6 are lower than many theoretical predictions. In order to gain insight, we investigate the evolution of the mfp in our new massive fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics cosmological simulation of reionization: Cosmic Dawn III (CoDa III). CoDa III's scale (\${\textbackslash}rm 94{\textasciicircum}3 {\textbackslash}, cMpc{\textasciicircum}3\$) and resolution (\${\textbackslash}rm 8192{\textasciicircum}3\$ grid) make it particularly suitable to study the IGM during reionization. The simulation was performed with RAMSES-CUDATON on Summit, and used 13 1072 processors coupled to 24 576 GPUs, making it the largest reionization simulation, and largest ever RAMSES simulation. A superior agreement with global constraints on reionization is obtained in CoDa III over Cosmic Dawn II (CoDa II), especially for the evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction and the cosmic photoionization rate, thanks to an improved calibration, later end of reionization (z = 5.6), and higher spatial resolution. Analysing the mfp, we find that CoDa III reproduces the most recent observations very well, from z = 6 to z = 4.6. We show that the distribution of the mfp in CoDa III is bimodal, with short (neutral) and long (ionized) mfp modes, due to the patchiness of reionization and the coexistence of neutral versus ionized regions during reionization. The neutral mode peaks at sub-kpc to kpc scales of mfp, while the ionized mode peak evolves from 0.1 Mpc h-1 at z = 7 to {\textasciitilde}10 Mpc h-1 at z = 5.2. Computing the mfp as the average of the ionized mode provides the best match to the recent observational determinations. The distribution reduces to a single neutral (ionized) mode at z {$>$} 13 (z {$<$} 5).},

  abstract = {We investigate the spatial offsets between dust and ultraviolet (UV) emission in high-redshift galaxies using the Cosmic Dawn III (CoDa III) simulation, a state-of-the-art fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics cosmological simulation. Recent observations have revealed puzzling spatial disparities between ALMA dust continuum and UV emission as seen by HST and JWST in galaxies at z=5-7, compelling us to propose a physical interpretation of such offsets. Our simulation, which incorporates a dynamical dust model, naturally reproduces these offsets in massive, UV-bright galaxies (log\$\_\{10\}\$(M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{DM\}\}\$/M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$){$>$}11.5, M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{AB1500\}\}\${$<$}-20). We find that dust-UV offsets increase with halo mass and UV brightness, reaching up to \${\textbackslash}sim 2\$ pkpc for the most massive systems, in good agreement with observational data from the ALPINE and REBELS surveys. Our analysis reveals that these offsets primarily result from severe dust extinction in galactic centers rather than a misalignment between dust and stellar mass distributions. The dust remains well-aligned with the bulk stellar component, and we predict the dust continuum should therefore align well with the stellar rest-frame NIR component, less affected by dust attenuation. This study provides crucial insights into the complex interplay between star formation, dust distribution, and observed galaxy morphologies during the epoch of reionization, highlighting the importance of dust in shaping the appearance of early galaxies at UV wavelengths.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) methods have become popular for parameter inference in cosmology, although their reliance on specific training data can cause difficulties when applied across different data sets. By reproducing and testing networks previously used in the field, and applied to 21cmFast and Simfast21 simulations, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often learn to identify features of individual simulation boxes rather than the underlying physics, limiting their applicability to real observations. We examine the prediction of the neutral fraction and astrophysical parameters from 21 cm maps and find that networks typically fail to generalise to unseen simulations. We explore a number of case studies to highlight factors that improve or degrade network performance. These results emphasise the responsibility on users to ensure ML models are applied correctly in 21 cm cosmology.},
